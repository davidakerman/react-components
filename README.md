# Open-sourced React and React Native Components used in Edumonk Systems 

### Components are based on - [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) for react and [react native elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements) for react-native
------------
These components can be independently used on your product.

All the plans are listed on projects section.

## Principles
Loosly follows [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

## Styling
- Currently SASS with [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) will be added in future
- Follow [BEM rules](http://getbem.com/) if not using dynamic styles

#### Every PR should
- pass lint
- pass tests
- be code reviewed by at least by one core contributer
- Every added component should have a [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
